## Introduction

Custom Field Suite (CFS) is a WordPress plugin which was adopted to add new functionality to the Crop for a Cause website.

The plugin's main usage currently is to provide a way to edit content on the [Upcoming Events](https://cropforacause.com/charity-crafting-events/) page.

## Configuration

There are two areas where CFS is configured and maintained.

1. Template pages are created as PHP files and subsequently added to the WordPress theme.
2. CFS Field Groups are configured in WordPress via Settings -> Custom Field Suite in the sidebar.
