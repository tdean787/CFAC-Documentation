## Homepage <a name="#homepage"></a>

The WordPress homepage is interacted with differently to the rest of the site. To get started with making changes to the page, you will need to go into Appearance -> Theme Options in the WordPress dashboard sidebar.

Instead of using a WYSIWYG editor or block editor for example, the homepage is divided into Sections that you can click into and edit.
